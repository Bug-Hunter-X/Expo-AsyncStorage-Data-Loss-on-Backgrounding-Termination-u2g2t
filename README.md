# Expo AsyncStorage Data Loss on Backgrounding/Termination

This repository demonstrates a common issue with AsyncStorage in Expo applications where data loss or corruption can occur if the app is backgrounded or terminated while an AsyncStorage operation is in progress.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using task management techniques.

## Problem

AsyncStorage operations, particularly writes, can be interrupted if the app is terminated or backgrounded before they complete. This leads to incomplete or inconsistent data. 

## Solution

The solution leverages Expo's background task management (Background Tasks API) to ensure AsyncStorage operations finish even if the app is backgrounded.  This is crucial for data integrity.
